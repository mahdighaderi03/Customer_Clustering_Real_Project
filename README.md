# Customer_Clustring_Real_Project
In this project, we want to divide customers into different groups using the clustering method.

## Method 1: K Means Clustering
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping groups or clusters. It aims to minimize the variance within each cluster by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster center and updating the center based on the mean of the points in that cluster. 

## Method 2: Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. Unlike K-means, hierarchical clustering builds a tree-like structure of clusters, known as a dendrogram, where each data point starts as its own cluster and then merges with other clusters based on their similarity. This process continues until all points belong to a single cluster or a specified number of clusters is reached. Hierarchical clustering methods can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), and they do not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.
